This project is a front-end web application built with React.js, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and TypeScript, designed to replicate the core functionality of the popular academic management platform Canvas. The app currently focuses on the user interface (UI) for managing courses, assignments, grades, and student profiles, providing a responsive and intuitive design for both students and instructors.

Key Features (UI):
Course management and enrollment interface
Assignment submission and grading interface
User profile management UI
Responsive and modern design with Bootstrap
Future Development:
In the future, I will be implementing the back-end of the application using MongoDB, JavaScript, and APIs to enable real-time data storage, retrieval, and user authentication. The goal is to create a fully functional academic management platform with seamless integration between front-end and back-end systems.

This project demonstrates the use of React.js and TypeScript for dynamic front-end development, while setting the stage for a complete full-stack solution.
