This project is a full-stack web application built with HTML, React.js, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and TypeScript, designed to replicate the core functionality of the popular academic management platform Canvas. The app provides a responsive and intuitive interface and fully integrated backend for managing courses, assignments, quizzes, grades, and user profiles, supporting distinct workflows for both students and instructors.

<strong> Key Features (UI): </strong> <br/>

Course dashboard with navigation for modules, assignments, quizzes, and people <br/>

Assignment submission and creation interface <br/>

User authentication and role-based UI for Faculty and Students <br/>

Responsive and modern design using Bootstrap <br/>

Personalized dashboard showing courses specific to the logged-in user <br/>

<strong> Back-End Functionality: </strong> <br/>
The back-end was developed using MongoDB, Express.js, and JavaScript, and is now fully implemented and integrated. Features include: <br/>

Real-time database interaction for courses, users, assignments, and quizzes <br/>

Role-based user authentication (Student or Faculty) <br/>

Secure login, signup, and session management <br/>

User-specific course visibility and enrollment system <br/>

Faculty can create and manage their own courses <br/>

Students can browse and enroll in available courses <br/>

<strong> Quizzes Functionality: </strong> <br/>
A complete quizzes module has been implemented, allowing both faculty and students to interact with quizzes based on their roles. <br/><br/>

<strong> Faculty Capabilities: </strong> <br/>

Create, edit, preview, publish/unpublish, and delete quizzes <br/>

Add multiple types of questions:

Multiple Choice

True/False

Fill in the Blank <br/>

Configure quiz settings such as:

Points, time limit, multiple attempts, access codes, availability windows, webcam requirement, shuffle answers, and more <br/>

Preview quizzes as a student (no results are stored) <br/>

<strong> Student Capabilities: </strong> <br/>

View available quizzes for their enrolled courses <br/>

Take quizzes (respecting available dates and number of allowed attempts) <br/>

View results and scores from their last attempt <br/>

Cannot access unpublished quizzes or edit quiz content <br/>

All student quiz attempts are stored individually, ensuring each user sees only their own results and progress. The interface clearly shows quiz availability, due dates, score feedback, and status (published/unpublished). Quizzes default to unpublished and can be toggled with a âœ…/ðŸš« icon.

This project demonstrates the use of React.js and TypeScript for dynamic front-end development while delivering a fully functional, secure back-end system. The Kambaz platform sets the foundation for scalable academic tools with a clean, user experience.
